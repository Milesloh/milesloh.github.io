<h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i><span face="Arial" color="#FF0000" style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial; text-decoration: underline;">Exponential Modeling and Solving Exponential Equations</span></i></span></h1>
<p><span face="Arial" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">2. Carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels is almost surely a cause of global warming.&nbsp; One of the difficulties in negotiating a treaty for the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions is the discrepancy in emission levels between developing and developed nations.&nbsp; For example, in 1999, Brazil emitted 89 million metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere, while Canada, a much less populous country, emitted 151 million metric tons.&nbsp; Brazil&rsquo;s emissions, however, are growing at 4.1% per year, while Canada&rsquo;s are growing at 0.8%.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">a. In Excel, make a table and using what you learned about exponential growth (percent increase), calculate when Brazil&rsquo;s emissions will exceed Canada&rsquo;s. Paste your table on your word document.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"></span>b.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">How much confidence you have in your prediction in b?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"></span>c.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Find formula for the exponential function which models Brazil&rsquo;s emissions (using 1999 as year 0).</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">d. Using the formula for Brazil&rsquo;s model, predict Brazil&rsquo;s emissions in 2010.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"></p>
<p><span face="Arial" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">3. In 1994, some samples from the archeological site at Oslonki, Poland were dated using carbon 14.&nbsp; The archeological site is significant for the large quantities of copper implements and jewelry&nbsp;found there.&nbsp; One of the samples had 47.8% of the carbon 14 that would normally be present in a living organism.&nbsp; (Carbon 14 decays approximately 1.202% every 100 years.) </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span face="Arial" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">a. Using Excel calculate the approximately how old the sample is.&nbsp; Paste the Excel table you used to calculate your answer. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span face="Arial" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">b. Using logs calculate the exact age of the sample. Show your calculation.</span></p>

<p><span face="Arial" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">4.&nbsp; In 1990, the population of the town Erehwon was 5000 and has been increasing by 2.9% every year.&nbsp; The population of the town Exalpon, Erehwon&rsquo;s nearest neighbor, was 4500 and increasing by 3.2% every year.&nbsp; When, will the population of Exalpon exceed Erehwon?</span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">b. Predict when there were no cell phone subscribers? (Since you do not have the data, use the slope and intercept that is given to you in the formula in the graph to calculate your answer)&nbsp; How much faith do you have in your prediction?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">c. How much faith do you have in your prediction?</span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">a. Make a single graph to answer this question: In 2006 what percentage of all degree-earning males and what percentage of all degree-earning females earned a Doctoral degree?</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">b. Make a single graph to answer this question: In 2006 what percentage of all those receiving a Doctoral degree were female and what percentage were male?</span></p>
